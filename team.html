                            <p>Hi, I’m Arisa and I love to help out the world to become a better place. I like to do small sustainable things to help the world out little by little. I joined GIN because I heard that it does all the things I like to help out with like clothing drives, bake sales, etc. My favorite SDG is #2 world hunger. I think it is so sad that people can’t have a thing we use every single day. I am excited to learn more and help out GIN as much as I can! &nbsp;</p>
