            <p><strong>Eco Fashion is a MUSTang passion!</strong> GIN's 2nd clothing drive running through November 7th, 2025. We have a strong stance against fast fashion and are large supporters of 2nd hand clothing! Please bring clothes without stains or rips in good condition. Drop-off locations: MS Room 306, MS Office (opened Oct 7th), and MS Entrance (opened Oct 7th).</p>

            <h3>Sneaker Drive 2025</h3>
            <p><strong>Success!</strong> We collected 379 sneakers! All successfully delivered to underprivileged communities and orphanages in Barili, Cebu, Philippines. This year we made it a whole-school Mustang Project including all divisions of ASIJ with parent community involvement. Our goal was 500 pairs (more than double last year's 240+ pairs). The drive ran from January 27 to February 21, 2025.</p>
            <p><strong>Partnership:</strong> Collaborating with Sneaker Kids Tokyo, a Japan-based organization that has donated over 13,000 pairs of shoes over 10 years to children in the Philippines.</p>

            <h3>Animal Advocacy - "give LOVE get LOVE"</h3>
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Over 6 million dogs enter shelters worldwide annually. Only 3 million are adopted and the rest face euthanasia. These dogs deserve a permanent home.</p>
            <p><strong>ARK Partnership:</strong> We partnered with ARK (Animal Refugee Kansai), established in 1990, sheltering dogs, cats, and even a bunny. We met with Ms. Okamoto at Futako Tamagawa station during their adoption event.</p>
            <p><strong>Winterfest Success:</strong> We successfully hosted an animal adoption event at Winterfest, bringing dogs and hamsters to ASIJ's largest annual event. Collaborated with the HS Animal Advocacy Club for manpower and awareness spreading.</p>

            <p><strong>Supporting Refugees:</strong> The 2025 Bake Sale supported refugees in the Middle East. We had the honor of meeting Shahd via Google Meet with Help4Refugees' Mr. Jordan Hattar. Shahd lost her home and family due to conflict and the 2023 earthquake. She is now studying in Turkey to become an interior designer and needs funding for counseling, tuition, food, and necessities.</p>
            <p><strong>Whole School Participation:</strong> All 6 houses were represented with close to 20 bakers from grades 6 to 8. It was a sweet day for giving and spreading compassion to people who need it most.</p>

            <h3>Book Drive - Supporting Education in the Philippines</h3>
            <p><strong>The Mission:</strong> Send unused, unneeded, and abandoned books from ASIJ to where they're needed most. Books were collected from humanities classrooms, the library, and storage spaces throughout campus.</p>
            <p><strong>Partner:</strong> Papaya Academy in the Philippines received all donated books to support their students' education.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Many books sit unused on shelves or in storage spaces - from the back of classrooms to forgotten closets. Why not bring those books to use and supply learning materials to people in need?</p>

            <h3>Paper Recycling Initiative - Every Classroom Counts</h3>
            <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Not all classrooms in ASIJ have paper recycling boxes. Most of our waste goes to incinerators, but why not recycle them and give them a second life?</p>
            <p><strong>Our Goal:</strong> To have every classroom on campus equipped with a paper recycling box. Recycling is important, not just P.E.T bottles but paper too!</p>
            <p><strong>Current Progress:</strong> We have a complete list of every Middle School classroom and whether they have recycling boxes or not. We are in the process of reaching out to people to purchase these boxes.</p>
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Recycling paper should be standard and normal. A circular economy is a worldwide goal that can happen at ASIJ too.</p>
